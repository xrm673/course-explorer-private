This course examines strategic business innovations in climate-smart agriculture, centered on the challenge of transforming global food systems with low carbon land-use practices. Students will use insights from economics to analyze the environmental impacts of farming and identify opportunities for transformative actions in agribusiness management. Our focus will be on four important economic sectors (rice, livestock, aquaculture, and agroforestry) in the context of three climate change mitigation strategies: (1) Sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; (2) Adapting and building resilience to climate change; and (3) Reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions.\n        ",

In 2022, the resolution is still very much in effect and having an impact on our world. Upon analyzing or reflecting on the text of the UN resolution and exploring its related goals and topics, we can quickly begin to identify the issues people, organizations, and governments are likely to argue over, or are already arguing over. Thus, UN goal and topic is up for argument, including facts (e.g., climate change) will be contested in one way or another, by someone or some group or another, and arguments of all kinds, formal and informal, will proliferate. It is amid these arguments about our sustainable future that this course will take place.

The World Bank's Doing Business report ranks nations in terms of how easy it is to do business in a nation. The UNDP ranks countries in terms of their level of \"human development\". This half semester course will introduce students to the theory and practice of rating and ranking nations in different ways. The students will be encouraged to develop their own ideas of new ways to rate and rank nations. One particular fledgling idea that will be discussed is how easy it is for citizens in different nations to interact with their government. We can call it the Living Life index, to chime with the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. It is hoped that by the end of the course we will have two or three concrete ideas for new ways of rating nations.\n        ",

We will address questions like: why do some countries grow quickly and others slowly? What factors prevent countries, households, and individuals from escaping the cycle of poverty? How do policymakers balance economic growth and environmental sustainability? Why don't financial markets work well in most developing countries, and do informal institutions fill the gap? How do we analyze the challenges facing small-scale farming households, and how do decisions by those households influence migration, labor markets, and the growth of industry? How do we evaluate policies and programs in order to understand what works for development? The approach in this course will be primarily microeconomic, although a basic understanding of macroeconomics is important for some topics. Emphasis will be on theory, real-world examples, and reading and interpreting research and policy papers.\n        ",

Next, we discuss bond market investing and the yield curve, as well as derivative contracts such as futures and options. Finally, we discuss selected topics in behavioral finance, an active subfield within finance that tries to improve our understanding of financial markets and investor behavior using frameworks that are psychologically realistic; here, topics include a set of systematic mistakes real-world investors make, the underlying mechanisms that cause these mistakes, and ways to improve financial decision making.\n        ",

Do you not want to take a final examination? If so this course may be for you. Since the beginning of the republic, American intellectuals, politicians and businessmen have extolled the exceptionalism of America. In a world of diverse forms of capitalism, can this view be sustained? Is America a shining city on the hill or a darkened city in the valley? Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to \"the West;\" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change.\u00a0\n        ",

The past four decades have seen the emergence of an important new paradigm, behavioral finance, which argues that many financial phenomena are the result of less than fully rational thinking and which draws on psychology to understand the ways in which people are not fully rational. This course provides an introduction to the field. We revisit basic topics in finance from a behavioral finance perspective: topics related to markets (stock market fluctuations, popular investment strategies, bubbles); topics related to investor behavior (poor investment decisions by households); and topics related to corporate finance (security issuance, mergers and acquisitions). A running theme in the course is that knowledge of behavioral finance is essential for anyone who seeks a full understanding of modern financial markets.\n        ",

The past four decades have seen the emergence of an important new paradigm, behavioral finance, which argues that many financial phenomena are the result of less than fully rational thinking and which draws on psychology to understand the ways in which people are not fully rational. This course provides an introduction to the field. We revisit basic topics in finance from a behavioral finance perspective: topics related to markets (stock market fluctuations, popular investment strategies, bubbles); topics related to investor behavior (poor investment decisions by households); and topics related to corporate finance (security issuance, mergers and acquisitions). A running theme in the course is that knowledge of behavioral finance is essential for anyone who seeks a full understanding of modern financial markets.\n        ",

This collaboration will allow students to immerse themselves in a professional setting in which they explore business opportunities; develop innovative concepts; and propose and prototype innovative and entrepreneurial solutions. Students will tackle issues and challenges such as new product, service or business model development; organizational structure and growth; and external threats and opportunities. Past clients include the City of Ithaca Economic Development and Finger Lakes ReUse.\n        ",

All this watching and working costs: in a recent year, Americans spent $56 billion on sporting events, $33 billion on athletic equipment, and $19 billon on gym memberships (compared to 27 billion spent on books). So much time and money spent suggests that people find sports intrinsically valuable. And so they do. But there's something else going on as well: sport is a window on lots of other stuff that matters, and probably matters more than sport. As a wine enthusiast once said to me, \"We don't spend all our time talking about wine because wine itself matters so much, we talk about wine 'cause it gives us a way of talking about what really matters.\" This course is built around having that kind of conversation: talking about sports as a way of taking about what really matters. The perspectives of sports fans and athletes are very welcome; we can have a better conversation about the big stuff if we have a rich understanding of, and appreciation of, sport itself. But we will want to keep our eyes on the prize \u2013 pressing, perennial, and difficult questions having to do with such issues as human nature, gender, race, justice, and \u2013 yes -- the meaning of life. Given sports' prominence in our lives, it's a little surprising that there isn't more scholarly writing on sports. It's perhaps less surprising that too much of the scholarly writing that exists has a way of turning dynamic into dreary. We'll read some academic scholarly offerings, but we'll also read material from more popular venues, where much of the best writing on sports turns up. We'll use these and other sources to shine some light on our cultures and, hopefully, ourselves.\n        ",
