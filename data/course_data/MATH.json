Examples from the life sciences are used throughout the course. To give a concrete example, we will study predator-prey populations. We will write down mathematical models that describe the evolution of these populations, analyze both quantitative and qualitative properties to make predictions about the future of these populations, and discuss the assumptions and limitations of the models. Note that while we will cover the topics of derivatives and integrals, this course has a different, much more applied, focus from courses such as MATH 1110\u00a0or a typical high school calculus course.\n        ",

Such a set is amenable to the methods of multivariable calculus. After a review of some relevant calculus, this course investigates manifolds and the structures that they are endowed with, such as tangent vectors, boundaries, orientations, and differential forms. The notion of a differential form encompasses such ideas as area forms and volume forms, the work exerted by a force, the flow of a fluid, and the curvature of a surface, space, or hyperspace. The course re-examines the integral theorems of vector calculus (Green, Gauss, and Stokes) in the light of differential forms and applies them to problems in partial differential equations, topology, fluid mechanics, and electromagnetism.\n        ",

The first semester of this sequence covers basic questions in graph theory, including extremal graph theory (how large must a graph be before one is guaranteed to have a certain subgraph) and Ramsey theory (which shows that large objects are forced to have structure). Variations on matching theory are discussed, including theorems of Dilworth, Hall, K\u00f6nig, and Birkhoff, and an introduction to network flow theory. Methods of enumeration (inclusion/exclusion, M\u00f6bius inversion, and generating functions) are introduced and applied to the problems of counting permutations, partitions, and triangulations.\n        ",
